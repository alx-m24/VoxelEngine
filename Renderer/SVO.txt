SVO -> May have 8 children:
	- 1 chunk = 1 SVO
	- Steps:
		1) If chunk/SVO is empty: End the octree/it is a leaf
		2) Else: Subdivide into 8 children
		3) If the new children are of the same size as 8 voxels: End octree/it is a leaf
		4) Else: restart from step 1 for each child
	- Stored & Sent:
		1) CPU:
			- Struct SVO {
					bool isLeaf;
					float size;
					vec3 lowerCorner;
					SVO children[8];
				}
		2) Linearized for SSBO:
			- vec4(vec3(lowerCorner), size) -> 4-th component is negative if it is a leaf
		3) Array:
			- vec4 SVO = {root, c1, c2, c3, c4, c5, c6, c7, c8, cc1, cc2, cc3, cc4, cc5, cc6, cc7, cc8...}
			- To get child: childIdx = currIdx * 8 + targetChildNum;
		4) Chunks:
			- vec4 chunk = {vec3(pos), first SVO node index};
